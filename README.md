# Cybersecurity Threat Detection System (MERN Stack)

## üöÄ Overview
A real-time web-based platform to detect, log, and visualize suspicious user activities (e.g., brute-force login attempts, SQL injections, suspicious IPs) using the MERN stack. Designed for organizations to proactively monitor and manage potential threats.

## üß± Tech Stack
- **MongoDB** ‚Äì Store logs, user metadata, threat categories, IP history, etc.
- **Express.js** ‚Äì RESTful APIs for data logging, authentication, and data retrieval.
- **React.js** ‚Äì Admin dashboard UI to visualize threats, alerts, and logs.
- **Node.js** ‚Äì Backend logic for processing logs, pattern matching, and alert generation.

## üß© Core Features
- **User Authentication & Authorization** (JWT, role-based)
- **Real-time Threat Logging** (REST API, IP, action, timestamp, geolocation)
- **Threat Analysis Engine** (Brute-force, SQLi, XSS detection)
- **Admin Dashboard** (Charts, filters, heatmaps, timelines)
- **Notification System** (Email/Slack/Webhooks)
- **Search & Audit Trail** (Full-text search, timeline view)
- **Security Measures** (HTTPS, CORS, rate limiting, Helmet.js, input validation)
